# Catalyst : A Flutter application(ios, android, windows and macOS compatible)

## Overview

Secure Authentication System is a Flutter application designed to provide a robust and secure authentication mechanism for users. Leveraging Firebase for backend services, this app focuses on security, error handling, and seamless user experience. It implements a structured architecture using the BLoC pattern for state management, ensuring efficient handling of authentication events and states.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Supports login and registration using email and password.
- **Secure Token Management**: Handles token storage and refreshes to maintain user sessions securely.
- **Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error handling to provide clear feedback to users.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes Firebase Firestore for storing and retrieving user data.
- **User Interface**: Offers a clean and intuitive UI for user interactions.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Manages the UI and user interactions.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Implemented using the BLoC pattern, handles authentication logic and state management.
- **Data Layer**: Interacts with Firebase services for authentication and database operations.
